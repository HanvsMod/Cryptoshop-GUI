<h1 class="western">What is PyQt?</h1>
<p>PyQt is a set of Python v2 and v3 bindings for <a href="http://www.qt.io/">The
Qt Company's</a> Qt application framework and runs on all platforms
supported by Qt including Windows, MacOS/X and Linux. PyQt5 supports
Qt v5. PyQt4 supports Qt v4 and will build against Qt v5. The
bindings are implemented as a set of Python modules and contain over
1,000 classes. 
</p>
<p>The Qt Company have announced that support for Qt v4 will cease at
the end of 2015. PyQt5 and Qt v5 are strongly recommended for all new
development. 
</p>
<p>PyQt is dual licensed on all supported platforms under the GNU GPL
v3 and the Riverbank Commercial License. Unlike Qt, PyQt is not
available under the LGPL. You can purchase the commercial version of
PyQt <a href="https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/commercial/buy">here</a>.
More information about licensing can be found in the <a href="https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/commercial/license-faq">License
FAQ</a>. 
</p>
<p>PyQt does not include a copy of Qt. You must obtain a correctly
licensed copy of Qt yourself. However, a binary Windows installers of
the GPL version of both PyQt5 and PyQt4 are provided and this
includes a copy of the LGPL version of Qt. 
</p>
<h2>PyQt Components</h2>
<p>A description of the components of PyQt5 can be found in the <a href="http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/introduction.html#pyqt5-components">PyQt5
Reference Guide</a>. 
</p>
<p>A description of the components of PyQt4 can be found in the <a href="http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/introduction.html#pyqt4-components">PyQt4
Reference Guide</a>. 
</p>
<h2>Why PyQt?</h2>
<p>PyQt brings together the <a href="http://qt.digia.com/">Qt</a> C++
cross-platform application framework and the cross-platform
interpreted language <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>. 
</p>
<p>Qt is more than a GUI toolkit. It includes abstractions of network
sockets, threads, Unicode, regular expressions, SQL databases, SVG,
OpenGL, XML, a fully functional web browser, a help system, a
multimedia framework, as well as a rich collection of GUI widgets. 
</p>
<p>Qt classes employ a signal/slot mechanism for communicating
between objects that is type safe but loosely coupled making it easy
to create re-usable software components. 
</p>
<p>Qt also includes Qt Designer, a graphical user interface designer.
PyQt is able to generate Python code from Qt Designer. It is also
possible to add new GUI controls written in Python to Qt Designer. 
</p>
<p>Python is a simple but powerful object-orientated language. Its
simplicity makes it easy to learn, but its power means that large and
complex applications can be created. Its interpreted nature means
that Python programmers are very productive because there is no
edit/compile/link/run development cycle. 
</p>
<p>Much of Python's power comes from its comprehensive set of
extension modules providing a wide variety of functions including
HTTP servers, XML parsers, database access, data compression tools
and, of course, graphical user interfaces. Extension modules are
usually implemented in either Python, C or C++. Using tools such as
<a href="https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/sip">SIP</a> it
is relatively straight forward to create an extension module that
encapsulates an existing C or C++ library. Used in this way, Python
can then become the glue to create new applications from established
libraries. 
</p>
<p>PyQt combines all the advantages of Qt and Python. A programmer
has all the power of Qt, but is able to exploit it with the
simplicity of Python.
