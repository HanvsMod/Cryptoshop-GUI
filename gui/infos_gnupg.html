<h2><a name="sec-1"></a>The GNU Privacy Guard</h2>
<div id="text-1" dir="ltr">
	<p>GnuPG is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP
	standard as defined by <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4880.txt">RFC4880</a>
	(also known as <i>PGP</i>). GnuPG allows to encrypt and sign your
	data and communication, features a versatile key management system
	as well as access modules for all kinds of public key directories.
	GnuPG, also known as <i>GPG</i>, is a command line tool with
	features for easy integration with other applications. A wealth of
	<a href="https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/frontends.html">frontend
	applications</a> and <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/libraries.html">libraries</a>
	are available. Version 2 of GnuPG also provides support for S/MIME
	and Secure Shell (ssh). 
	</p>
	<p>GnuPG is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free
	Software</a> (meaning that it respects your freedom). It can be
	freely used, modified and distributed under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU
	General Public License</a> . 
	</p>
	<p>GnuPG comes in three flavours: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">2.0.30 is the <i>stable</i>
		version suggested for most users, 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">2.1.11 is the brand-new <i>modern</i>
		version with support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography">ECC</a>
		and many other new features, 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p>and 1.4.20 is the <i>classic</i> portable version. 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>Project <a href="https://www.gpg4win.org/">Gpg4win</a> provides a
	Windows version of GnuPG <i>stable</i>. It is nicely integrated into
	an installer and features several frontends as well as English and
	German manuals.

<div id="text-2" dir="ltr">
	<p>Even if you have nothing to hide, using encryption helps protect
	the privacy of people you communicate with, and makes life difficult
	for bulk surveillance systems. If you do have something important to
	hide, you are in good company; GnuPG is one of the tools that Edward
	Snowden used to uncover his secrets about the NSA.

	Self-Defense</a> site to learn how and why you should use GnuPG for
	your electronic communication. If you need printed leaflets check
